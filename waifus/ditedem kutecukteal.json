		"Spoilers: Both Chariot and Croix went to class together. In episode 15, Croix graduated from Luna Nova in 2007. In episode 23, we see that Chariot preformed while she was still in school. By knowing that, the last performance has to be in or before 2007, when they graduated. 2007 + 10 years is 2017. Meaning the story takes place during 2017 or earlier. Her age during the first episode is 16. 2017 - 16 years is 2001."
